    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Josh</strong>, and I'm a full-stack software engineer with experience developing high-performance APIs, services, and web applications in C# and .NET in my current role at <a href="https://www.listrak.com">Listrak</a>. I also graduated from Viking Code School, where I learned Agile development and TDD while pair programming and working on group projects with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and AngularJS. I'm a quick learner and always want to take my knowledge deeper. I care about what I do and about having a positive impact with my work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also strive to live a full and balanced life. I love spending time with my wife and our kids, gardening, and playing guitar and bass guitar.
