				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I have always been a very curious person who is always interested in learning new things. I am a software developer, and I am working on making that my career by studying web development as part of the January 2016 cohort of Viking Code School. My goal is to get a job as a web developer and develop exciting new web applications. My amazing wife, Ashlinn, has been supportive through all of this. I'm also currently a stay-at-home dad to my active and brilliant 1-year-old daughter, Eleanor. That is a lot of fun and a lot of work! On the side, I have been doing communications for The Arc of Pennsylvania.</p>
