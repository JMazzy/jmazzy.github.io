    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Josh</strong>, and I'm a full-stack web developer with experience developing modern web applications using Ruby on Rails and AngularJS. I am proficient with Ruby and JavaScript, I know some Java, and I have dabbled in C/C++ and Elixir. While studying at Viking Code School, I also learned Agile development and TDD while pair programming and working on group projects. I'm a quick learner and always want to take my knowledge deeper. I care about what I do and about having a positive impact with my work.

      I also strive to live a full and balanced life. I love spending time with my wife and our daughter. I hike and kayak. I play guitar, bass, mandolin, and just about any other fretted instrument I can get my hands on. I have a dog named Obsidian (a.k.a. Obi), who is named after a rock, a beer, or Obi-Wan Kenobi depending on who you ask.
