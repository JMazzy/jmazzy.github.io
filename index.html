			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a curious person who is always learning new things. As of 2015, I am a computer programmer and stay at home dad to my 1-year-old daughter. I am part of the January 2016 cohort of Viking Code School and I am excited about that. My goal is to start a career in web development after I am finished with that, developing interactive web apps that are useful and successful. I have had a rather tumultuous career path, but that has given me unique perspectives and passions. Click the "My Story" tab above for more.</p>
