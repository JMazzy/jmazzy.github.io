			<h2>About Me</h2>
			
			<p>I am a curious person who is always learning new things. As of 2015, I am a computer programmer and stay at home dad to my 1-year-old daughter. I am part of the January 2016 cohort of Viking Code School and I am excited about that. My goal is to start a career in web development after I am finished with that, developing interactive web apps that are useful and successful. I have had a rather tumultuous career path, but that has given me unique perspectives and passions. Click the "My Story" tab above for more.</p>

			<h2>Why is my name so long?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>My last name is so long because my wife and I decided to join names when we got married. It can be unwieldy at times but we like it. We chose the order because it sounds better than the reverse, but it often confuses people because my original last name (Masland) comes before hers (Sarani).</p>
