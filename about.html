          <p>I have always been a very curious person who is always interested in learning new things. I am a software developer, and I am working on making that my career by studying web development as part of the January 2016 cohort of Viking Code School. My goal is to get a job as a web developer and develop exciting web applications. My amazing wife, Ashlinn, and toddler daughter, Eleanor, have been supportive through all of this.</p>
