<p>This past week was my first week in Viking Code School, a 16-week intensive program for learning the Ruby on Rails web development framework (among many other things). I’m exhausted, but it has been an awesome learning experience already.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing for me has been pair programming — I wasn’t sure about it going in but it seems like a great approach if done right. It is helpful as an extra “sanity check”, and forces me to explain things more coherently. Pairs check each other’s bugs and share knowledge.</p>

<p>Week 2 is sure to bring lots more challenges and in looking forward to starting.</p>
